# Advanced Style Profiles Guide

## Overview

Advanced Style Profiles in WordWise allow you to create, save, and apply different writing style configurations based on your document type, audience, or personal preferences. Think of them as "writing personalities" that instantly transform how the grammar checker evaluates your text.

## Features

### 1. Pre-built Style Profiles

WordWise comes with six pre-configured profiles optimized for different writing contexts:

- **üìö Academic Writing**: Formal tone, complex sentences, citations, no contractions
- **üíº Business Professional**: Clear, concise, action-oriented, professional tone
- **‚úçÔ∏è Creative Writing**: Flexible grammar, stylistic fragments, rich language
- **üîß Technical Documentation**: Imperative mood, consistent terminology, step-by-step
- **üìß Email Communication**: Adaptive tone, clear CTAs, appropriate greetings
- **üí¨ Social Media**: Character limits, hashtags, engagement-focused

### 2. Profile-Aware Grammar Checking

When a profile is active:
- Grammar rules adjust to match the writing style
- AI suggestions consider the profile's requirements
- Certain "errors" may be ignored if appropriate for the style
- New suggestions appear based on profile-specific rules

### 3. Smart Profile Detection

WordWise can automatically detect and suggest the appropriate profile based on your document content.

### Example 2: Sentence Fragments

**Academic Profile Active**:
- "Because of the results." ‚ùå (flags as error)

**Creative Profile Active**:
- "Because of the results." ‚úì (accepts for style)

### Example 3: Passive Voice

**Technical Profile Active**:
- "The button should be pressed" ‚úì (appropriate for instructions)

**Business Profile Active**:
- "The button should be pressed" ‚Üí "Press the button" (suggests active voice)

## Integration with AI Grammar Checking

When AI checking is enabled, the style profile:
1. Modifies the AI prompt to understand your writing context
2. Adjusts confidence scores based on profile rules
3. Provides profile-specific suggestions
4. Learns from your acceptance patterns per profile

## Best Practices

1. **Set Profile First**: Select your profile before starting to write
2. **Document Association**: Let WordWise remember profiles per document
3. **Custom Profiles**: Create custom profiles for specific clients or projects
4. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review profile suggestions to refine settings
5. **Context Switching**: Use different profiles for different sections (manually switch)

## Troubleshooting

### Profile Not Affecting Suggestions
- Ensure AI grammar checking is enabled for full profile integration
- Check that the profile is actually active (blue highlight)
- Some rules only apply to new text typed after activation

### Auto-detect Not Working
- Needs at least 100 words of content
- Works best with clear document markers (e.g., "Dear" for emails)
- May default to "Business" if uncertain

### Suggestions Seem Wrong for Profile
- Profiles are guidelines, not absolute rules
- You can always ignore suggestions that don't fit
- Consider creating a custom profile for unique needs

## Profile Customization (Coming Soon)

Future updates will allow:
- Creating fully custom profiles
- Adjusting individual rule weights
- Importing/exporting profiles
- Team profile sharing
- Industry-specific templates

## Privacy & Data

- No content is shared between users
- Profile usage helps improve suggestions (optional)
