# Alternative Approach: Using Supabase User Metadata

If you continue to have issues with the user registration flow, here's an alternative approach that uses Supabase's built-in user metadata instead of a separate table for basic preferences:

## Option 1: Use User Metadata for Basic Preferences

Instead of creating user_preferences immediately, you can store basic onboarding status in the user's metadata:

```javascript
// When completing onboarding
const { error } = await supabase.auth.updateUser({
  data: {
    onboarding_completed: true,
    onboarding_completed_at: new Date().toISOString()
  }
})

// Check onboarding status
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
const needsOnboarding = !user?.user_metadata?.onboarding_completed
```

## Option 2: Create Preferences on First Login

Instead of creating preferences during registration, create them when the user first logs in:

```javascript
// In your auth state change handler
supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(async (event, session) => {
  if (event === 'SIGNED_IN' && session?.user) {
    // Ensure user preferences exist
    await userPreferencesService.getUserPreferences(session.user.id)
  }
})
```

## Option 3: Manual Preference Creation

Keep the current approach but ensure preferences are created lazily when needed:

1. Remove the automatic trigger (already done)
2. Create preferences when first accessed (already implemented)
3. Handle edge cases gracefully

## Recommended Solution

For now, the fix we've implemented should work:

1. The problematic trigger has been removed
2. Preferences are created automatically when first accessed
3. The system handles missing preferences gracefully

This approach is safer and won't interfere with Supabase's authentication flow.
